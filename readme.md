This app is an app that pulls up current weather conditions at ski areas. You can either search by city, and the API will get the closest ski area or you can enter a specific ski area.


To Do:
Add in new API's:
  - yelp
  - geolocation

- Add ability to add resorts to My Resorts as links
Add ability to remove resorts from my resorts

- If signed in, you see menu, if not you see sign up / login

Handle errors gracefully
- add controller file for restful routes
generally clean up code -  maybe compile CSS into sass

Stretch goals/add ons:
Add in geolocation "find closest resort"
flickr API
Add tags
